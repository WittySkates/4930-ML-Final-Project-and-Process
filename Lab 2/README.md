# Lab 2 - Feature Generation, Feature Extraction & Feature Selection

This is a project group assignment.

**Due: Monday, February 24, 11:59 PM**

## Grading Rubric

1. **Problem 1 (20 pts)**
    * **Additional training (0 pts):** If you decide to use more training samples, you can include them in this lab.
    
    * **Training data discussion (20 pts):** your discussion includes all the listed topics.
    
2. **Problem 2 (30 pts)** 
    * **Image transformation (15 pts):** you've transformed the training data, discussed advantages/disadvantages on the transformation and displayed a few samples.
    
    * **Image normalization (15 pts):** you've normalized the training data, discussed advantages/disadvantages on the normalization and displayed a few samples.

3. **Problem 3 (50 pts)**
    * **Feature Generators (20 pts):** you've generated features using PCA and HOG.
    
    * **Cluster-validity metrics (20 pts):** you've implemented the quality metrics for each feature descriptor.

    * **Feature Discussion (10 pts):** you've provided a discussion about feature quality. This discussion should use your plotting schemes and the results from quality metrics.
    
**Total: 100 pts**

# Feature Extraction & Feature Selection

The objective of Lab 2 is to introduce to the importance of pre-processing, normalization, feature generation, feature extraction and feature selection. You will develop, implement and compare several pre-processing pipelines on the collected project data sets. You will also implement feature visualization scripts and cluster validity-type metrics to aid in your pre-processing evaluation and visualization.

**You can use ```scikit-learn``` modules.**

**Objectives**

By completing this assignment you will practice and master the following skills:

* Image pre-processing for object classification
* Different types of normalization
* Feature Generation for image analysis
* Feature Extraction & Feature Selection
* Visualization and quality assessment of features
