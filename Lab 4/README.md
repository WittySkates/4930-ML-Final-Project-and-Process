# Lab 4 - Final Pipeline for ASL Data Classification

This is a project group assignment.

**Due: Friday, April 10, 11:59 PM**

## Grading Rubric

1. **Problem 1 (10 pts):** you have included a screenshot of your Zoom meeting/s.
    
2. **Problem 2 (90 pts):** you have finalized your end-to-end machine learning pipeline, have included a set of experiments to evaluate the performance of your model and included a discussion of your results.

**Total: 100 pts**

# End-to-End Pipeline for ASL Data Classification

The objective of Lab 4 is to finalize your choice of pre-processing pipeline and classifier selection, provide discussion and motivation for the chosen approach based on outcomes from Labs 1-3.

**You can use ```scikit-learn``` or ```PyTorch``` libraries.**

**Objectives**

By completing this assignment you will practice and master the following skills:

* Experimental design
* Setup of an end-to-end approach using supervised learning techniques
* Library function' implementation and parameter tuning

**Create your Repo**

You can create the repo for this assignment by visiting the following link: https://classroom.github.com/g/hC0gy-1A

# Training Data Set

The training data set was collected from the entire class of EEL 4930. The training set contains 1844 samples of $100\times 100$ RGB images. 
* You can download both the training data set (**"train_data.npy"**) and training labels (**"train_labels.npy"**) from our Canvas page [here](https://ufl.instructure.com/courses/395133/files/folder/Project%20Data).

# Problem 1 Description

As we have moved to a virtual environment communication, I am recommending that each team meet via Zoom.

You can schedule meetings that best work for your team here: https://ufl.zoom.us/

* Attach a screenshot proof that you have created a meeting and attended the meeting via Zoom.

* To facilitate collaborative coding while you are communicating via Zoom, I recommend that you use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). 
    * You can edit all your Jupter Notebooks in this platform. The updates are live so your teammates can view and participate in real time.
    
# Problem 2 Description

In this lab you will finalize your end-to-end machine learning pipeline whichs includes pre-processing, classification and evaluation of the results for the ASL data set. The choice of your final approach will be based on outcomes from Lasb 1-3.

Include a new section of experiments for the classification you choose. Your experiments should include all the standard steps of a machine learning algorithm or deep learning architecture.

Provide a discussion for each step of your pipeline. This approach should be the one used to carry out experimental design on your final project code and report.

## Submit your Solution

Along with your Jupyter Notebook answers, create a PDF of the notebook with your solutions.

As always, `add` and `commit` the final version of your work, and `push` your code to your GitHub repository.

* Submit the **URL** of your GitHub Repository as your assignment submission on Canvas (only one team member needs to do so).
